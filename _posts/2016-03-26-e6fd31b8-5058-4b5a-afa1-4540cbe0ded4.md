Yesterday was a sad day in football. We all said goodbye to a legend. Thank you Johan Cruyff for making football beautiful, and instilling the value of total football to all those you played with, coached, and taught. The magnitude of your influence on the game is just starting to be understood. You will be missed. Rest In Peace. My thoughts and prayers are with your family and friends.

"It's better to go down with your own vision than with someone else's." 

-Johan Cruyff
